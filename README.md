#Parkinson’s Disease Prediction using SVM
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the presence of Parkinson’s Disease based on biomedical voice measurements.

Features
Utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification

Preprocesses data to improve model accuracy

Evaluates performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall

Dataset
Uses the publicly available Parkinson’s Disease dataset containing voice signal features.

How to Run
Install required packages:

`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main script:

`bash
python parkinson_prediction.py
Results
Achieved classification accuracy of 89.74% 

Effective early prediction support for Parkinson’s diagnosis
