# Parkinson’s Disease Prediction using SVM

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the presence of Parkinson’s Disease based on biomedical voice measurements.

## Features

* Utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification
* Preprocesses data to improve model accuracy
* Evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, and recall

## Dataset

Uses the publicly available Parkinson’s Disease dataset containing voice signal features.

## How to Run

1. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python parkinson_prediction.py
   ```

## Results

* Achieved classification accuracy of **89.74%**
* Provides effective early prediction support for Parkinson’s diagnosis
